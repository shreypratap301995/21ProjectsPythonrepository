# Project 4: Heart Disease Prediction (Classification) ðŸ©º

**Project Objective:** To build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a patient has heart disease based on a set of medical attributes. This project will serve as a comprehensive introduction to classification, one of the most common types of machine learning problems.


### Core Concepts We'll Cover:
1.  **Classification Fundamentals:** Understanding the goal of predicting a discrete category.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Classification:** Analyzing features to find patterns that distinguish between classes.
3.  **Data Preprocessing:** Preparing data for classification models using encoding and feature scaling.
4.  **Model Building:** Training and comparing a simple baseline model (Logistic Regression) with an advanced ensemble model (Random Forest).
5.  **Model Evaluation:** Mastering key classification metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and interpreting the Confusion Matrix.
6.  **Feature Importance:** Identifying the most influential medical factors for predicting heart disease.
