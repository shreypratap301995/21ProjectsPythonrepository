End-to-End Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic Dataset
Project Objective: To perform a comprehensive, step-by-step exploratory data analysis to understand the key factors that influenced survival on the Titanic. This notebook will serve as a complete guide, covering data loading, cleaning, analysis, feature engineering, and visualization, with theoretical explanations at each stage.

What is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)?
Exploratory Data Analysis is the crucial process of performing initial investigations on data to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations. It is not about formal modeling or hypothesis testing; rather, it is about getting to know your data before you start building models.

Why is it important?

1.   Understand the Data: It helps you understand the variables and their  relationships.
2.   Data Cleaning: It reveals missing values, outliers, and other inconsistencies that need to be handled.
3.   Feature Selection: It helps identify which variables are the most important for your problem (feature engineering and selection).
4.   Assumption Checking: It allows you to check assumptions that are required  for certain machine learning models (e.g., normality, linearity).
